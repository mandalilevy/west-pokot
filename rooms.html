									<div class="a">
										Centuries ago, setting out to climb a mountain would have been considered close to insanity. Mountains were places of peril, not beauty, an upper world to be shunned, not sought out. Why do mountains mesmerize us now, drawing us into their territory, often at the cost of our lives? Mountain is a cinematic and musical ambiance.<BR>Mount Kogh, a name with a lot of resonance befitting 2608 m, is steep, with almost erecting rock rising for 300m from a northerly branch of the Cheranganis. A visit to this place and you will leave with a respect for the Mother Nature. The pure size, the mountain range and the clear skies seen from above. <BR> It is mountain, trail ride drive through Chesta Guest House, Chemurlokotio road. But there are more trails to follow and more days to enjoy here. Snakes of different species are also found here such as Black mamba, forest cobra and rock python among others. The area is ideal for; paragliding, mountain climbing and bird watching </DIV>
